  Description:
    Abstract: These data are derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, or alternative satellite imagery when Landsat is not available.  The pre-fire and post-fire image subsets for this fire were used to create a Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), or a Relative Differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RdNDVI).  The RdNBR or RdNDVI is correlated to the variation of burn severity within a fire.  The RdNBR or RdNDVI data are calibrated with the Composite Burn Index (CBI) as well as tree mortality variables.  See the USGS National Burn Severity Mapping web site at: http://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/fire_main.asp for generic information on fire severity mapping procedures.  The severity ratings provided by the derived products listed below are based on the severity to vegetation.  At this time, the layers are still considered draft.  For a description of RdNBR see: Miller, J. D. and A. E. Thode (2007).  Quantifying burn severity in a heterogeneous landscape with a relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR).  Remote Sensing of Environment, 109:66-80.

    Purpose: These data were created by the USDA Forest Service - Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) to support USFS Washington Office Forest Management, Regional Silviculturists, and Reforestation and Restoration Specialists.

      Process_Description:
        These data products are derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data, or alternative satellite imagery when Landsat is not available.  A pre-fire scene and a post-fire scene are analyzed to create a Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) image, or a Relative Differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RdNDVI) when using alternative imagery.  The RdNBR or RdNDVI image portrays the variation of burn severity within the fire.  The following description is specific to Landsat image data, but when alternative satellite imagery are used the formulas are modified to produce appropriate burn severity data.

        The pre and post-fire images are terrain corrected and geometrically rectified to the Albers projection using a NAD83 horizontal datum.  The Landsat images are further processed to convert bands 1-5 and 7 to at-sensor-reflectance.  The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for each date of Landsat imagery using the following formula:
        (Band 4 - Band 7) / (Band 4 + Band 7) = NBR

        The Differenced NBR which is correlated to the amount of pre-fire vegetation is computed by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR and scaled by 1000 to convert to integer format:
        (PreNBR - PostNBR)*1000 = dNBR

        The Relative Differenced NBR is computed to determine severity by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR and dividing by the square root of the prefire NBR:
        (PreNBR - PostNBR)/sqrt(abs(PreNBR/1000)) = RdNBR

        Higher RdNBR values are correlated with more severe burns.  The RdNBR image is converted to CBI units based upon a regression model.  The CBI based severity classes represented on the classified map were “calibrated” from field data collected one year post-fire on several fires from 2001 through 2004.  Calibrated data uses field data collected on that fire or fires that occurred in similar vegetation types to calibrate or determine where the cutoff thresholds are set.  The Composite Burn Index (CBI) field protocol was used to measure severity in the field.  The CBI is a composite linear combination of fire effects experienced at a site encompassing all vegetation strata from the forest floor to the upper canopy.  CBI values of .1, 1.25, and 2.25 were chosen to correspond to the low, moderate and high thresholds.  General descriptions of the severity classes are:

        Unchanged: This means the area one year after the fire was indistinguishable from pre-fire conditions.  This does not always indicate the area did not burn.

        Low: Represents areas of surface fire with little change in cover and little mortality of the structurally dominant vegetation.

        Moderate: This severity class is between low and high and means there is a mixture of effects on the structurally dominant vegetation.

        High: Represents areas where the dominant vegetation has high to complete mortality.

        Percent change in basal area was calibrated through regression analysis of the RdNBR index to percent basal area tree mortality (a tree with no green foliage one year post-fire was defined as being dead) as measured in the same field plots as where the CBI data were collected one year post-fire.  The regression model was applied to the whole fire extent regardless of vegetation type existing pre-fire.  Therefore the percent change in basal area may not represent actual mortality due to delayed mortality, resprouting, or non-tree vegetation.

        Percent change in canopy cover was calibrated through regression analysis of the RdNBR index to change in percent tree canopy cover as measured in the same field plots as where the CBI data were collected one year post-fire.  Pre-fire cover was determined through photo interpretation of pre-fire digital orthophotos.  The regression model was applied to the whole fire extent regardless of vegetation type existing pre-fire.  Therefore the percent change in canopy cover may not represent actual mortality due to delayed mortality, resprouting, or non-tree vegetation.

        The following models were used for Extended assessments:
                CBI = (1/0.388)*LN((RdNBR+369)/421.7)
                %ba_mort = (SIN((RdNBR-143.7)/405.1))^2*100
                %cc_mort = (SIN((RdNBR-181.1)/393.71))^2*100

        Calibrated thresholds for Initial assessments were derived through regression modeling of satellite reflectance values from imagery collected one year post-fire to imagery acquired immediate post-fire.

        The following models were used for Initial assessments:
                CBI = (1/0.388)*LN((RdNBR/1.1438325+369)/421.7)
                %ba_mort =(SIN((RdNBR/1.1438325-143.7)/405.1))^2*100
                %cc_mort =(SIN((RdNBR/1.1438325-181.1)/393.71))^2*100
