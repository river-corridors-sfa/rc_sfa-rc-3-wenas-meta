The purpose of this script is to merge DOC and NO3 data from Hampton that has a slight offset in their dates so I want to merge this dataframes and then export them out into my sheet format

## Load libraries 
```{r Jake/Mac}
#for Jake/mac

rm(list=ls(all=T)) #this clears your Environment

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

```

```{r - read in dataframe}
mast_NO3 <- read_csv(here("inputs", "Studies", "Mast_Clow_2008", "Mast and Clow - 2008 - NO3_Extracted-R.csv")) 

mast_DOC <- read_csv(here("inputs", "Studies", "Mast_Clow_2008", "Mast and Clow - 2008 - DOC_Extracted-R.csv")) 


```

```{r merge}
mast_combined <- full_join(mast_NO3, mast_DOC) %>% 
  mutate(DateTime = mdy(SampleDate)) 

mast_combined <- mast_combined[order(mast_combined$DateTime), ]

```


```{r export}
write_csv(mast_combined, here("inputs", "Studies", "Mast_Clow_2008", "Mast_DOC_NO3_merged.csv"))
```
