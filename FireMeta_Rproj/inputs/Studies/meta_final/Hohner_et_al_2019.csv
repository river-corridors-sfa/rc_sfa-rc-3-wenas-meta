Hohner et al. 2019,10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00670,Control_Reference_vs_Impact,39.177683,-105.26552,,Dfb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don’t think we can add this paper because it doesn't quite have what we are looking for. Fig. 4 has data from the High Park fire from 2012 but no NO3 or DOC data. Figure 5 has nitrate-N and DOC data from the Hayman fire from 2002 but they are seasonal means (rising limb/falling limb and baseflow) so I dont think we can use this.
