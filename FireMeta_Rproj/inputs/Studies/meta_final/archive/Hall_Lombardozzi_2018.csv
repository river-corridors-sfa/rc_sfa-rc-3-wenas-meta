Creeks were sampled within the burn and upstream of the burn but on the same creek. Samples were taken in 2003 (1 year since fire). Table 3 sampling consists of the mean of 3 samples samples taken at each site, samples were taken in 2004 (2 years since fire). The individual sites don’t have coordinates but I should be able to get them as the figure is pretty detailed and has coordinates on them so I can extract. Also Table 1 has stream characteristics. "
